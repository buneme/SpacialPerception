                <h4>Classification of Automation</h4>
                <p>
                  The first classification system of automation was first introduced in 2014 in a publication by SAE international,
                  standard J3016 ‘Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems’.
                  The main purpose of this standard was to “provide a common taxonomy and definitions for automated driving
                  in order to simplify communication and facilitate collaboration within technical and policy domains.” [1]
                  There was a former classification system proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in United States in 2013,
                  but was replaced by SAE standard in 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The classification system “identifies six levels of driving automation from no automation to full automation.” [1]
                  These six levels are mainly divided into two parts;
                  Level 0 to level 2 involve human intervention during driving,
                  while level 3 to 5 do not need any human intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some key terms to be known to better understand the taxonomy.
                    These definitions were from [1].
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Dynamic driving task includes the operational (steering, braking, accelerating, monitoring the vehicle and roadway)
                  and tactical (responding to events, determining when to change lanes, turn, use signals, etc.) aspects of the driving tasks,
                  but not the strategic (determining destinations and waypoints) aspect of the driving task.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Driving mode is a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements
                  (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Request to Intervene is notification by the automated driving system to a human driver
                  that s/he should promptly begin or resume performance of the dynamic driving task. “ [1]
                </p>

                <h5> Analysis on Each Level in the Classification</h5>
                <p>
                  Level 0: System does not intervene or warn human drivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Level 1: Both system and driver have controls over the vehicle.
                  System can control steering, acceleration and deceleration.
                  Still, human driver has to do the majority of the work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Level 2: Even though the system takes full controls on the vehicles,
                  human driver always has to be ready to intervene.
                  Tesla’s Autopilot system is often described as level 2,
                  as the autopilot system does not activate
                  if human driver takes their hands off from the wheel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Level 3: From level 3 to 5, the system itself monitors the driving environment.
                  At level 3,system can perform most of the driving tasks,
                  but it still requires human driver to be prepared for the intervention request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Level 4: At this level, the system must perform all the driving tasks;
                  If there is no response from human driver after the intervention is requested,
                  the system must make its own decision, for example, park the car on the side of the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Level 5: There is no need of human driver at this level.
                  All the driving tasks will be performed by the system.
                </p>
