## Computing topics
[Piazza Page](https://piazza.com/class/j8byqanqgfx66)
This website is based on [this template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/). It is published under the [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) which means that the only limitations are liability and warrenty, which won't be an issue for us.
The website is built on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) which is just a framework that helps poeple to build responsive sites with a consistent design.


## Github
If you are not sure about how to use github, I found a [good article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) that should help you understand the basics of collabarating using Github. The most important thing to remeber is to do your work on a seperate branch when editing your content and then merging afterwards

## Structure
##### Personal page
There is 1 personal page for each of us, e.g `hubert.html` etc. This is meant to be an "individual page on a subject of your choice e.g. CV, interest/hobby, topic not related to computing, etc".
##### Posts
On the main page I've put placeholders like \*job 2 title here\*. These numbers are just the jobs that we put in the google document, so you can fill in the placeholders once you have added your content. You can use `post_template.html` as a starting point for your content section.
##### Other
Try and keep images in the `img` folder, and that's about it.
