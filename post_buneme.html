            Stands for Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
            Technically, SLAM doesn’t refer to a specific algorithm or software, but its just the problem of trying to do these 2 things at the same time:
            Localisation: work out the position/orientation of an object using sensors and navigate environment
            Mapping the structure of the environment that the robot is in
            For these reasons SLAM is most useful when the robot needs to be 100% autonomous, GPS is unavailable, or when there is no prior knowledge about the environment
            Examples of such a situation would be autonomous planetary exploration, subsea autonomous vehicles, autonomous airborne vehicles, and autonomous vehicles used in tasks like mining
            The optical sensors are 1D (single beam) 2D (sweeping laser rangefinders) or 3D High definition LiDar (these are just examples). These sensors are used to extract landmark information.
            Tactile sensors (sensing by touch) can also be used to extract landmark data but these only contain information about points that are very close to the object.
            Most practical SLAM tasks involve a mixture of visual and tactile sensors

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
